## Hardware Hub - Custom website built in HTML and CSS

This projected was completed under Microverse remote software development curriculum. The project requirement was to build a locally hosted custom website of three pages. The design for guidance was provided [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) that was authored by Mathew Njunguna and Sam Achola on behance. The landing page for this local website is a search page which links to a results page and ultimately links to the details page. The build in this repository simulates an online directory of hardware stores.

Here is a screenshot of the clone
